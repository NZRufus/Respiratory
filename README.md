# Respiratory #
## Aims and Objectives ##
To explore the differences if any between different respiratory conditions as compared to healthy controls
## Source of Data ##
This data was taken from the Exasens.csv file provided on the Kaggle Website
## Libraries and Methods ##
This was using Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) for Statistical Analysis to minimise the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
## Results and Conclusions ##
There was a signficant difference between groups as compared to healthy controls but the main thing to note was that smoking had a large increased risk for those with respiratory conditions as well as getting older had a higher prevalence in the conditions compared to healthy controls
